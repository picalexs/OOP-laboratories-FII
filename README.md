## Overview

This repository groups ten progressively challenging lab assignments designed to cement understanding of object‑oriented design principles in C++98. Each lab focuses on one or more pillars of OOP, reinforcing theory with hands‑on problem solving.

## Labs and Learning Outcomes

### Lab 1: Classes and Objects  
– Designed simple classes to model real‑world entities (e.g., `Point`, `Circle`).  
– Practiced defining attributes, methods, and encapsulating state.

### Lab 2: Encapsulation and Access Specifiers  
– Applied `private`, `protected`, and `public` to control access.  
– Built getter/setter interfaces and enforced class invariants.

### Lab 3: Constructors, Destructors, and Dynamic Allocation  
– Implemented parameterized constructors, copy constructors, and destructors.  
– Managed heap‑allocated resources and learned the Rule of Three.

### Lab 4: Inheritance (Single and Multiple)  
– Extended base classes to create derived types (e.g., `Employee` → `Manager`).  
– Handled multiple inheritance scenarios with virtual base classes.

### Lab 5: Polymorphism and Virtual Functions  
– Used virtual methods and abstract base classes to enable runtime dispatch.  
– Created class hierarchies where derived behavior overrides base interfaces.

### Lab 6: Operator Overloading  
– Overloaded arithmetic, comparison, and stream operators (`+`, `==`, `<<`).  
– Ensured intuitive usage and correct semantics for user‑defined types.

### Lab 7: Templates and Generic Programming  
– Wrote function and class templates (e.g., `Vector<T>`, `swap<T>`).  
– Monitored compilation behavior and template instantiation.

### Lab 8: Exception Handling and Error Reporting  
– Threw and caught exceptions to handle invalid states and I/O errors.  
– Designed custom exception classes and used RAII for resource safety.

### Lab 9: File I/O and Serialization  
– Read from and wrote to text and binary files using streams.  
– Serialized object state for persistence and reconstruction.

### Lab 10: Standard Template Library (STL)  
– Leveraged containers (`std::vector`, `std::map`), algorithms (`std::sort`), and iterators.  
– Compared STL abstractions with custom implementations.
